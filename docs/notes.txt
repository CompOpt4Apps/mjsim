    Added a MeggyDisplay, and MeggyClear node to the ast so that I can clear and
    update the display state of the meggy jr.  With the added commands the
    generated asm compiles into an intel hex file.

    ast_visitor/AVRVisitor.java - added the function call for the drawPix
    command.  Need to figure out how to do the byte.  If we make everything two
    bytes then I will need to make sure to issue extra pop commands when
    grabbing a byte of off the stack.  Also, need to edit the grammar to support
    a byte type.  Changed some comments to the new style in AVR which
    appears to be C style.
    avrH.rtl.s - added call init into the file to make sure that the init call
    is always made to set up the hardware.

    ast_visitor/AVRVisitor.java - added the inColor method to push the supported
    colors onto the stack.  Determined that it would be easier to push the
    paramaters onto the stack first and then pop them off and into registers
    when a function call is made.

    ast/node/MeggySetPix.java - added this statement node so that I can
    write the function to set a pixel on the Meggy Screen.  Added the
    functions in the DepthFirst and ReverseDepthFirst so that all the
    visitors can function correctly.
    mj_ast.cup - edited the cup file to correctly parse the meggySetPix
    statement and generate the correct nodes in the ast.

    MileStone 1:  Was able to lex and parse all of the new features
    correctly.  The ast is also being generated correctly, as well as the line
    information.  Next step is to generate the correct AVR assem such that a
    working example can be compiled. (That will be MileStone 2).

    AVRgenVisitor.java:
        private pop - the pop has been replaced with the avr equivilent.
    TestCasesMeggy - added the test case from the e-mail.
    mj.lex - Added the following symbols:
                -import
                -meggy.Meggy
                -Meggy.SetPixel
                -Meggy.Red
                -Meggy.GREEN
                -Meggy.YELLOW
                -Meggy.BLUE
                -Meggy.NONE
    mj_ast.cup - added the symbols for import meggy.Meggy Meggy.SetPixel and
    Meggy.Red
    grammar.html - Added some new rules to the grammar to allow some of the
    meggy options to be included.
    ast/node/Import.java - added a node for the meggy import.  I made sure to
    put all the correct methods inside of the default visitors.  Also added the
    rules inside of the grammar in mj_ast.cup  I ran it on the first test case
    and it finds it.
    ast/node/Color.java - added a node for the color for the set pixel.  I made
    sure to add the correct methods inside of the visitor classes.  I also made
    sure to add the grammar in mj_ast.cup.  I needed this before I could write
    the ast for the Meggy.setPixel function.

    AVRgenVisitor.java:
        Constructor - added the avrH.rtl.s so that all the program header
        information is included from this file.
        private push function - replaced with a single push avr instruction.
        halloc - think it will be replaced by the avrlibc malloc function since we
        are going to link to it already.  Dunno if this is what we want to do yet.
        private loadConstantFunction - replaced the instruction for a single
        register.  Added another function (loadConstantHiLo) so that we can load
        pointers which are 16 bits.
    meggy:
        Moved all the meggy build files into the meggy subdir.  Modified the
        Makefile in the root directory to only build the compiler.  There is a
        seperate Makefile inside of the meggy folder which will build the meggy
        binaries there.
