README for MeggySim/RegressionTesting/
======================================
MJ.jar (revision 97), 2/16/11, MMS

To run the regression tests:

    (1) do a "make" in the MeggySim/ home directory
       to create MeggySim/MJSIM.jar
       
    (2) cd RegressionTesting
    
    (3) ./regress.sh
    
All of the .java files in the RegressionTesting/ subdirectory will
be run with the Java-only version and be run through the MJ.jar
compiler to generate AVR assembly that is then run through the
MJSIM.jar in batch mode.  The text output from both should match.

Anytime a new version of the MeggyJava compiler (MJ.jar) is generated,
this file should be updated with the revision number for that program.

TODO
----
- modify MJSIM.jar so that it can read in an arg_opts file as well
