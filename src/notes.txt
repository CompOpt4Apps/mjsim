	Apache Pivot - I'm going to use Apache Pivot to create the GUI interface for
	the simulator.  I will make both a gui and batch mode for the simulator.
	In the GUI version a callback will be registered that will listen for any 
	updates that happen when the program is being run, when in batch mode
	I will only register callbacks for the printing.  This should be interesting.

    Ideas -- Will need to do a traversal over the ast of the asm so that I can
    determine all of the function calls there are and see which ones are user
    defined and which ones are assumed.  The ones that are assumed I will have
    to write - like all of the gcc function calls to perform the 2 byte
    addition with the 1 byte registers.  This is the same for mul, and for the
    meggypixset etc...
